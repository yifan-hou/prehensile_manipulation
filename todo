Basic rules/facts
The space can be divided into the following parts:
1. Infeasible range: whole space minus cone{Ch}
    Physically impossible forces. E.g. pull using a contact.
2. Unstable range: cone{Ch} minus cone{-Ce}
    It's possible to be at those places, but the force from hand can not be balanced by the environment. Acceleration will generate and quasi-static balance assumption will break.
3. Stable range: intersection of cone{Ch} and cone{-Ce} force equilibrium is possible in these ranges. It can further be divided based on specific contact modes.


dimensionality of a range: does it have to be of certain dimensional to be feasible?


1. those regions shows the contact forces when the object is in equilibrium. Other regions are either infeasible modes or unstable modes
2. you can control force in the force controlled subspace. The force in the rest of dimensions is not directly controllable.
3. Given a velocity command, forces in the velocity controlled dimensions will will accumulate to put you in one of the modes that are compatible.
